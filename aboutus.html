        <p>Sarrat is a town in the province of Ilocos Norte in the Philippines. It is located in the northern part of the island of Luzon. The town is known for its historical and cultural significance, as well as its natural beauty. Cabayugan was how the people called Sarrat by its first settlers led by the village chief Minagel (Maingel) Bang'at and his wife Sarrah, before the arrival of the Spaniards on the latter part of the 16th century.[5] Sarrat is a compound of the couple's names and is believed to be coined by their son Garo.</p>
