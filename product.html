            <th class="th1"><ins>Binakol</ins> is a textile that is found originally in Sarrat. It can be woven into an array of products such as bags, coin purses, leis and the most popular product, blankets. The dizzying, playful and colorful patterns can be attributed to the belief that they would be confusing and dizzying enough to ward off evil spirits they preyed on sleeping people.
            Binakol weaving has long been considered a dying industry as younger generations have grown further and further away from the practice. In an attempt to maintain the industry, Sarrat holds an annual Binakol Festival meant to promote Binakol weaving and to showcase the handicrafts.</th>

            <th class="th2">When exploring a new place, one of the best ways to immerse yourself is to eat as the locals do! Some of the local favorites are easily found being cooked and sold roadside or at some of the stores. Take a bite into <ins>"Tupig"</ins>  which is basically a glutinous rice cake wrapped in banana leaves. It comes with melted butter and is garnished with grated coconut and sesame seeds.
            Another glutinous rice cake treat you should try is "Patupat" which is made with coconut milk, sugar and a sprinkle of salt. Don't miss out on their "Sapin-sapin" which is again a glutinous rice cake with coconut milk but with several layers. Each layer has a different color and flavor, making it a delicious symphony in your mouth.</th>
